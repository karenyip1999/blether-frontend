## Project Aims

Our project aim is to create a client-side interactive chatroom for a server-side Spring API previously created by the back-end team. Our initial intention was to create this chatroom with an admin perspective with the ability to view, edit and delete all users, messages and chatrooms. This was later adapted to cater to a user-oriented experience by creating functionality to allow a user to login/signup where we could implement age-restricted chatrooms and allow users to enter many chatrooms with multiple users.

## MVP

### Initial Approach
Planning:
* [x] Create trello board to track tasks to do, completed tasks and log errors
* [x] Create wireframe
* [x] Create props diagram

<!-- 
Old MVPs:
Users:
* [x] Admin can delete user
* [x] Admin can enter new user details
* [x] Admin can update user details
* [x] Admin can search/filter users
Chatrooms:
* [x] Admin can create a chatroom
* [x] Admin can update chatroom details
* [x] Admin can delete a chatroom
* [x] Admin search/filter chatrooms
Messages:
* [x] Admin can view users messages
-->

Started off with admin perspective.

Build on top of admin dashboard to create user oriented website with sign up and profile pages.
Pivot to user perspective

Login page:

* [x] User can edit their details
* [x] User can search through their own messages

Users page:
